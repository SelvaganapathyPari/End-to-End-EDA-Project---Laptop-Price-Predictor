# EDA Project- Laptop Price Prediction

#### This project's main goal is to perform data cleaning and feature engineering operations.

Cleaning the data, splitting and creating separate columns to extract usable information from the features, and selecting the features that are required to predict the laptop price are all challenges in this project. 

There are numerous features such as laptop brand, laptop type, CPU, screen size, RAM, graphics card, storage (HDD,SDD, etc.) that can be used to predict the price of a laptop.
